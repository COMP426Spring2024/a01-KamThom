                The Solavis, a mysterious bird-like creature, has been a subject of fascination and intrigue for centuries.
                Its existence was first documented in 1609 by Thomas Harriot, who saw what appeared to be an "angel in space" while observing the moon.
                However, subsequent attempts to view the creature were unsuccessful, leading Harriot to believe that it was just a smudge on his lens.
            </p>
                It wasn't until the Plumbob Nuclear Experiments of 1957 that the Solavis was seen again.
                A scientist at the Los Alamos testing facility captured an image of the creature while observing the predicted atmospheric exit point of
                a manhole cover launched into space at an incredible speed of 37 miles per second. Two on-site astronomers independently verified the
                sighting, confirming the presence of a large, bird-like object in orbit around the Earth.
                <p class="p2">
                Despite this incredible discovery, the Solavis did not receive much attention from the broader scientific community,
                as it posed no apparent threat and showed no signs of being valuable. It was only among niche groups that the object was discussed,
                and even then, it was mostly out of curiosity.
            </p>
                However, interest in the Solavis was renewed in 1961 when Yuri Gagarin reported seeing a glowing, white,
                bird-like entity while orbiting the Earth. The Russian government suspected that it was American spy equipment,
            <p class="p3">
                Subsequent sightings of the Solavis showed a pattern of appearing only when humans made technological advances in space.
                Scientists began inventing new technologies solely for the chance to capture this elusive creature on film, leading to the second
                image of the bird being captured in 1971 by a crew of three Russians who later died mysteriously on Soyuz 11.
            </p>
                Despite the secrecy surrounding the Solavis, scientists all over the world continue to study it in secret. The creature seems
                \to be comprised of the same elements found in our sun and radiates similar types of energy, leading many to speculate that it
                is born from the core of a dying star and has a purpose of watching and protecting all space-faring beings, including humans.
            <p class="p4">
                Though the Solavis has never stayed around long enough to be studied in depth, there is enough data to suggest that it is an
                intelligent creature. However, due to the likelihood of mass panic, if its existence were to be revealed, a blanket of secrecy
                has been placed over the entire subject.
